# Project 3: Automation Workflow Prototype (n8n)

This project demonstrates my ability to build business-critical automation and integration workflows using modern AI-era tools like n8n.

## Workflow Details: Lead Qualification Pipeline

* **Purpose:** Simulates the process of capturing a new client inquiry (via Webhook) and running an immediate qualification check (via the Function node). This demonstrates my ability to implement resilient custom JavaScript business rules within a visual automation platform.
* **Tool Used:** n8n (Visual Automation Platform)
* **Note on Accessibility:** Due to platform restrictions in the free-tier service, a public share link could not be generated. The entire blueprint is provided below via a publicly accessible screenshot.
